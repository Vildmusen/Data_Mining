A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.\\nL245 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he\\'s orchestrating the battle, you\\'re in a position of power. We let him pretend he\\'s calling the shots, and while he\\'s busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.\\nL244 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You got him involved?\\nL225 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey -- I\\'ve gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.\\nL224 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I thought you hated those people.\\nL223 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you\\'d be set.

Do you think we\\'ve got a plan or not?\\nL219 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I\\'m serious, man, he\\'s whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.\\nL218 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?\\nL217 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No kidding.

She\\'s not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that\\'s an impossibility.\\nL91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why not?\\nL90 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don\\'t even think about it\\nL89 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Who is she?\\nL88 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You burn, you pine, you perish?\\nL87 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That girl -- I --\\nL78 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.

She\\'d never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn\\'t in jail, I don\\'t know Marilyn Manson, and I\\'ve never slept with a Spice Girl.

I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.\\nL2015 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Is that all that interests you? Gold?\\nL2014 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.\\nL2012 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If they agree to follow me, yes.\\nL2011 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Your life, and that of others!\\nL2010 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.\\nL2006 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Excellency, you are right.\\nL2005 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.\\nL1993 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.\\nL1992 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am, Your Eminence\\nL1991 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?\\nL1990 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.\\nL1989 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ You say Asia can be found by sailing west?\\nL2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.\\nL2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...\\nL2522 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You can see for yourself.\\nL2275 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.\\nL2274 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ It won\\'t be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.\\nL2031 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.\\nL2030 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?\\nL2029 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.\\nL2028 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ The Judgment is ours!\\nL2027 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ The State has some reason to be interested in this man\\'s proposition, Your Eminence...\\nL2540 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can\\'t keep my eyes off you.

Do you think I care?  I\\'m a free man again.  Riches don\\'t make a man rich, they only make him busier...\\nL2473 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They took everything...\\nL2472 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They tried... but I didn\\'t let them.\\nL2471 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ God... you\\'re so beautiful!  I can\\'t believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...\\nL2320 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.\\nL2319 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ You don\\'t usually ask.\\nL2318 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Beatrix, I want to ask you something.\\nL2123 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ That\\'s something you can\\'t decide.\\nL2122 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I don\\'t want you to wait for me.\\nL2121 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I\\'m not asking you to swear to anything.\\nL2119 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ Thank God...\\nL2118 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ She said yes.\\nL1986 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I find that hard to believe.\\nL1985 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...\\nL1984 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I\\'d love to argue with you sometimes.

I have a child by a man who won\\'t marry me!  Who\\'s always leaving...\\nL1981 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I haven\\'t given you much of a life.\\nL1980 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I know.\\nL1979 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I could be gone for years.\\nL2432 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am afraid this is not the worst news.\\nL2431 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.\\nL2430 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.\\nL2429 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How far from here?\\nL2426 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Congratulations.

I wouldn\\'t know where to start... and yet...\\nL2550 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.\\nL2549 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He never had one... except aboard my ships!\\nL2548 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.\\nL2547 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What does he say?\\nL2542 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I am not listening, Father.  But I can\\'t help hearing.\\nL2541 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What are you listening to?\\nL2501 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ There must be a passage to that other ocean.\\nL2500 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Father...\\nL2485 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Not bad.\\nL2484 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How are you feeling, Fernando?\\nL2440 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ This time with me!\\nL2439 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I have to explore the mainland.\\nL2131 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes...

Do I have so many already?\\nL2299 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You seem to have a special talent for making friends.\\nL2297 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!\\nL2296 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.\\nL2295 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.\\nL2287 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ ... for a commoner?\\nL2286 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You defend yourself admirably...\\nL2282 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?\\nL2281 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They don\\'t see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...\\nL2110 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ If you won\\'t accept our proposal, we\\'ll simply find someone who will.\\nL2109 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?\\nL2108 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then you are too ambitious.\\nL2107 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I\\'m not bargaining!\\nL2106 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.\\nL2105 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!\\nL2104 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No?\\nL2103 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No...\\nL2410 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You never learned how to speak my language.\\nL2409 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Utapan, won\\'t you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.\\nL2394 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You did the same to your God!\\nL2393 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!\\nL2343 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Ask him if he will help.\\nL2342 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ He understands.\\nL2341 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We will work with his people.

Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.\\nL2250 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief knows.\\nL2249 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Tell the Chief we thank him.\\nL2248 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You come!

You trust me...\\nL2140 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!\\nL2139 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.\\nL2138 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How long?\\nL2137 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.\\nL2136 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ What are you saying?\\nL2135 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Father, I have betrayed my family.

I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.\\nL2458 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ There is one thing I\\'d like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?\\nL2457 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thank you.\\nL2456 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.\\nL2280 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They come and go as naked as the day God created them...\\nL2279 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Do they have such thoughts?\\nL2086 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?\\nL2085 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ How old are you, Senor Colon?\\nL2082 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ A woman?\\nL2081 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn\\'t accept the world as it is.  Who\\'s not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... \"What if?\"...\\nL2080 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You show no inclination to speak otherwise!\\nL2079 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ May I speak freely?\\nL2077 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Surely you can do anything you want.\\nL2076 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.\\nL2075 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ That she was impregnable.\\nL2074 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What did they say about Granada before today?\\nL2073 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ The ocean is uncrossable?\\nL2072 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.\\nL2071 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.\\nL2389 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You will regret this.\\nL2388 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You\\'ll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?\\nL2387 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ Savagery is what monkeys understand.\\nL2386 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!\\nL2348 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.\\nL2347 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Don Moxica -- we all have to work.\\nL2346 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ My horse doesn\\'t work.\\nL2345 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We can\\'t raise the wheel without it.\\nL2333 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.\\nL2332 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We don\\'t need to know.\\nL2331 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?\\nL2329 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you\\'ll do as I say.\\nL2328 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.\\nL2278 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.\\nL2277 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don\\'t see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.\\nL2492 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ We can\\'t be.\\nL2491 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He\\'s drawing an isthmus... He\\'s saying we\\'re on an isthmus.\\nL2490 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ What\\'s he doing?\\nL2165 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Twenty eight.\\nL2164 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you read?\\nL2160 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Come over here.\\nL2159 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I\\'ve never seen it used at night before.\\nL2158 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And what do you think Mendez?\\nL2157 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well... It\\'s the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We\\'ve lost sight from land days ago...\\nL2155 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ God be with us admiral.\\nL2154 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...\\nL2211 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You\\'re right.  Let the men decide.\\nL2210 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You tell that to them!\\nL2209 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!\\nL2208 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You bloody...\\nL2207 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?\\nL2206 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!\\nL2205 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!\\nL2204 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You don\\'t know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I\\'m telling you we\\'re turning back!\\nL2203 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The land is there.  I know it!\\nL2202 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We\\'re lost!\\nL2201 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You think I don\\'t know that?\\nL2200 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We\\'re on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!\\nL2199 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!\\nL2198 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You must be mad...!\\nL2197 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Six days ago, yes.\\nL2196 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You lied!  You cheated!  We\\'re way past 750 leagues!\\nL2065 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Immediately.\\nL2064 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Where can I meet this man?\\nL2462 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Because he is not afraid of me.\\nL2461 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then why?\\nL2460 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.\\nL2419 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ And who would you think of, for such a task?\\nL2418 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ He must be replaced.\\nL2417 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?\\nL2415 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is this true, Brother Buyl?\\nL2414 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...\\nL2377 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ We weren\\'t expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.\\nL2376 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.\\nL2116 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn\\'t it?  Call him back!\\nL2115 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... Into a monk...\\nL2113 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Never, Your Majesty.  Although...\\nL2112 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.\\nL1931 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Yes, Your Majesty.\\nL1930 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?\\nL3546 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Officers, there\\'s your killer, do your duty, arrest him!\\nL3545 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...\\nL3497 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I don\\'t think it\\'s abuse, I think it\\'s torture.\\nL3496 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I\\'m abused.  Don\\'t you think?\\nL3493 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Can I see your back?\\nL3492 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Out on my back when I was a small boy.\\nL3491 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father put cigarettes out on you?\\nL3490 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ That\\'s what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.\\nL3489 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?\\nL3488 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father blamed you for your mother\\'s blindness?\\nL3487 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...\\nL3486 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Back in the Czech Republic?\\nL3485 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me.

Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.\\nL3482 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.\\nL3481 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Give me another one, please.\\nL3480 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I need to know about your background.

I need your trust in me.\\nL3477 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don\\'t try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.

How much?\\nL3472 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Look, I haven\\'t really focused on that kind of thing.\\nL3471 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about my movie rights?  Book rights?\\nL3470 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Don\\'t worry about him.  Think about yourself.\\nL3469 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No, he is here.  Shit...\\nL3468 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Disappeared.  They\\'re looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.\\nL3467 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about Oleg?\\nL3466 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Well, you didn\\'t appreciate the severity of it until recently.

I didn\\'t mean to...I\\'m glad. Actually I\\'m glad it\\'s over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...\\nL3180 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They\\'re not gonna send you right back.\\nL3179 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ You don\\'t know.

I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn\\'t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could\\'ve made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it\\'s not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig\\'s.\\nL3166 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No.\\nL3165 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What about back home?\\nL3164 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No.\\nL3163 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Did you ever turn tricks before?\\nL3162 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Yes, I considered it.\\nL3161 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You considered becoming a prostitute?\\nL3160 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah.  This way.\\nL3159 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ So...the station is empty?\\nL3158 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.\\nL3097 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Somewhere else?\\nL3096 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I can\\'t take you to my place.\\nL3095 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Do you live alone?  I\\'ve been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?\\nL3094 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Divorced.\\nL3093 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Are you married?\\nL3092 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They won\\'t until this is over.\\nL3091 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I will if they don\\'t send me back.\\nL3090 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they\\'ll help you with your situation.\\nL3089 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Now I become custody of police department?\\nL3061 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Yes, but he was a cop.\\nL3060 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Alright.  That\\'s a justifiable homicide.\\nL3059 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.\\nL3065 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ You\\'re a cop - you\\'ll never believe me.\\nL3064 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what\\'s happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?\\nL3063 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I\\'m from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.\\nL3062 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A cop?\\nL3056 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No, no, don\\'t talk to Immigration!\\nL3055 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you here illegally?

You know these people?\\nL3045 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I told your partner, I can\\'t help.

Beep me when you\\'re ready for the press conference.\\nL3213 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I\\'m ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.\\nL3212 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh yeah...?  Alright.\\nL3211 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.\\nL3210 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Well, I\\'m the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I\\'d like to be included in decisions.\\nL3209 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It was my decision, not his.\\nL3208 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh.\\nL3506 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ There\\'s nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You\\'re suspended until your trial.\\nL3505 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But Chief?  Over this??\\nL3504 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn\\'t gotten away and you\\'d been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You\\'d have the good to weight against the bad! It\\'s unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there\\'s nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.\\nL3503 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ End my career?\\nL3502 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.\\nL3501 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.\\nL3500 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!\\nL3499 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.\\nL3498 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ The public doesn\\'t have any idea what we do and now you\\'re going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!\\nL3294 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Okay.  But not water sports.\\nL3293 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Chief - mind if I take her?\\nL3203 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh really.  That\\'s nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin\\' dates?!\\nL3202 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ No!  Nothing happened.\\nL3201 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ A shower!?  Did you take one, too?\\nL3200 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I let her take a shower.\\nL3199 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What do you mean, \\'cleaned up?\\'\\nL3198 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.\\nL3197 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you\\'re not here.  I wait up at the station and you don\\'t even show up!!!  I beep you - you don\\'t return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!\\nL3196 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?\\nL2800 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ \\'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.\\nL2799 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Then why didn\\'t you talk to the reporter?\\nL2798 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Who do you think, Chief?!\\nL2797 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Who did cause and origin?\\nL3292 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL3291 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?\\nL3290 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.\\nL3289 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?\\nL2805 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ You do that, wiseguy.  Now let\\'s solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.\\nL2804 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ I said, yeah, you\\'re right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin\\' we\\'ll let you alert the media.\\nL2803 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What was that, Korfin?\\nL2802 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah, right.\\nL2801 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Don\\'t you guys understand?  It\\'s all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.\\nL3028 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll get those fuckers.\\nL3027 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!\\nL3023 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.  I\\'m okay.\\nL3022 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you hit?\\nL3017 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Stay with her.\\nL3016 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don\\'t look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.\\nL2938 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ C\\'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.\\nL2937 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL2936 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Only one guys checked in?\\nL2925 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It\\'s okay.\\nL2924 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Sorry...PD only.\\nL2923 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Still unknown but we\\'re running prints. Kid over there caught the case.\\nL2922 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Any I.D.?\\nL2921 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Takin\\' a bath.\\nL2920 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where is she?\\nL2752 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A timer.\\nL2751 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What\\'s he looking for?\\nL2633 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You ready?\\nL2632 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tomorrow.  At lunch.\\nL2631 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ When?\\nL2630 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I\\'m gonna propose.\\nL2603 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What\\'s the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I\\'m not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin\\' his dog or buyin\\' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid\\'s robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can\\'t tell if he\\'s a piece of beef or a human being and I\\'m thinkin\\' that\\'s me. Sooner or later.  That\\'s me.\\nL2602 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It was freaky, I\\'ll tell you.  Stupid kid.\\nL2601 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?\\nL2600 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Vodka tonic.\\nL2599 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.\\nL2990 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ She washes hair up at Ludwig\\'s - a salon on 63rd and Madison.\\nL2989 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!\\nL2988 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler\\'s build.  And he wouldn\\'t turn his videocamera off me.\\nL2987 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Describe him.\\nL2986 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.\\nL2981 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.\\nL2980 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you saying?\\nL2979 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy, she\\'s so popular all the sudden.\\nL2978 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Did you tell him you did?\\nL2977 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.\\nL2976 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do you have any Czech girls working for you?\\nL2975 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey \\'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn\\'t really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...\\nL2973 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey\\'s dead?\\nL2972 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don\\'t have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.\\nL2971 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What\\'s wrong?\\nL2967 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It\\'s Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.\\nL2966 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have nothin\\' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...\\nL2965 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Police.  We\\'d like to ask you a few questions.\\nL2964 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Who\\'s there?\\nL3230 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know, I don\\'t know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.\\nL3229 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why\\'d you help me back there with the Chief?  Why\\'d you stand up for me like that?\\nL3228 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here\\'s a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That\\'s how you help her. But you can\\'t get involved in her like that.  You\\'re gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you\\'re gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don\\'t watch TV but I\\'ll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin\\' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin\\' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.\\nL3227 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But, I mean, didn\\'t you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin\\' her whole story...I believed her.\\nL3226 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, it\\'s not up to you to decide whether she\\'s innocent or not.  Don\\'t you understand, that\\'s why you\\'re a professional.\\nL3225 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she\\'s innocent.\\nL3224 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, I don\\'t think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don\\'t know her well enough. She\\'s got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it\\'s fuckin\\' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You\\'re dead.\\nL3223 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I\\'m sure you probably think I\\'m a fool and I fucked up, but...\\nL3222 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just a shower?\\nL3221 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I took her there for a shower and that\\'s it.\\nL3220 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, you shoulda because nobody\\'s gonna believe you didn\\'t...including me.\\nL3219 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, Eddie, I\\'m tellin\\' you - I didn\\'t touch her.\\nL3082 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.\\nL3081 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey.  I\\'m a professional.\\nL3080 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, tell you what, I\\'ll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don\\'t let her out of your sight. She\\'s the only warm body we got left.\\nL3079 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You know what I\\'m saying here.\\nL3078 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You\\'re her Savior?  Is she the kid you\\'re gonna save from the burning building?\\nL3077 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ C\\'mon.  You intimidate her \\'cause you\\'re a celebrity.  She sees me differently.\\nL3076 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So am I.\\nL3075 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I\\'m serious here.\\nL3074 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ My point exactly.\\nL3073 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I don\\'t have a girlfriend.\\nL3072 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What would your girlfriend think of that?\\nL3071 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL3070 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You wanna talk to her alone?\\nL3069 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they\\'re all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.\\nL3068 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Raw deal.\\nL3067 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ She\\'s fucked.  Even if that story is true.\\nL3058 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Something back home?\\nL3057 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why not?\\nL3054 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Is that all there is?\\nL3053 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.\\nL3052 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid\\nL2999 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then I guess we\\'re doin\\' this the right way, aren\\'t we?  If we pull up to a burning building I\\'ll gladly let you go first.\\nL2998 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.\\nL2997 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling \\'Freeze!\\' at the bad guy! What\\'d you dream about?\\nL2996 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Of course.\\nL2995 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So am I.  Alright, I\\'ll go inside and you cover the back.\\nL2994 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I\\'m on duty.\\nL2993 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You thirsty?\\nL2992 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I\\'m on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig\\'s. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.\\nL2991 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig\\'s.\\nL2963 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Better than one.\\nL2962 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Two heads.\\nL2958 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I\\'ll call it... tails.\\nL2957 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tell you what - I\\'ll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don\\'t win, you don\\'t come.\\nL2956 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ This is ridiculous.  I\\'m not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.\\nL2955 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I\\'ll let you know what happens.\\nL2953 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But what if it does?  You might need my help.\\nL2952 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This has nothing to do with your fire.\\nL2951 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Mind if I ride along with you?\\nL2950 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got any better ideas?\\nL2949 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You goin\\' to the escort service?\\nL2906 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Stay here.\\nL2905 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ My folks are.\\nL2904 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You\\'re Polish?\\nL2903 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.\\nL2902 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This isn\\'t homicide school.\\nL2901 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I\\'ll learn something.\\nL2900 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There wasn\\'t a fire.  There\\'ll be nothing for you to do.\\nL2899 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I\\'ll come with you.\\nL2897 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.\\nL2896 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?\\nL2895 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Maybe it\\'s a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it\\'s like condemning them to hell.\\nL2893 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, I\\'m not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?\\nL2892 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What would you call her?\\nL2891 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Who says she\\'s a suspect?\\nL2890 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe you don\\'t care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I\\'ve had in awhile.\\nL2889 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hmmmm.\\nL2888 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pretty.\\nL2887 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The Super said he\\'d seen her before but she didn\\'t live here.\\nL2886 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That\\'s usually an indicator of something personal.\\nL2885 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If you found me steppin\\' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?\\nL2884 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?\\nL2883 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Did you get a report from the M.E.?\\nL2882 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Commendable.\\nL2881 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I don\\'t even watch TV.\\nL2880 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nah, why should you?\\nL2879 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Well, just so you know, I don\\'t care about that stuff.\\nL2878 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.\\nL2877 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Nah, I musta missed it.\\nL2876 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Watch the news?\\nL2875 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ It\\'s your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.\\nL2748 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why don\\'t you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?\\nL2747 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, what is it?\\nL2746 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You know what that is, right?\\nL2731 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, we don\\'t mind.  You mind Leon?\\nL2730 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey, that\\'s great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don\\'t mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin\\' to do.\\nL3249 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Smarter than Americans.  You\\'re fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they\\'ll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?\\nL3248 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You really think you\\'ll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin\\' stupid are you?\\nL3244 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ If you kill me and film it you\\'re putting a noose around your neck.\\nL3243 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ So tabloids don\\'t have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.\\nL3242 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.\\nL3241 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then do it, asshole.\\nL3240 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I kill someone famous.\\nL3239 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What\\'s your accomplishment.\\nL3238 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.

But there\\'s only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don\\'t share credit.\\nL3374 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes.

Don\\'t you realize, if it wasn\\'t for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.\\nL3368 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?\\nL3366 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Be quiet.

I took particular care not to freeze them.\\nL4283 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, now that we\\'ve got one that\\'s actually failed, we should be able to figure out what\\'s happened and fix it.\\nL4282 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ It\\'s the last one.\\nL4209 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes.\\nL4208 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Hal?\\nL4199 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, I hope there\\'s nothing wrong with the assembly on those.

What\\'s up?\\nL4189 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Are you reasonably awake?\\nL4188 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Good morning. How\\'s it going?\\nL4163 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Anyway, it\\'s just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.\\nL4162 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, but it\\'s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.\\nL4161 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.\\nL4160 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, I don\\'t know what to make of it.\\nL4159 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, that\\'s something.\\nL4017 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.\\nL4016 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I guess it isn\\'t.\\nL4015 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I suppose it isn\\'t logically impossible.\\nL4014 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ But not completely inconceivable?\\nL4013 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I know. It would be almost inconceivable.\\nL4012 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, but it\\'s to fantastic to think that they\\'d keep something from us.\\nL4011 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn\\'t really make any sense to keep us apart during training.\\nL4001 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ That\\'s true.\\nL4000 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Just ask Hal. It\\'s conceivable they might keep something from us, but they\\'d never keep anything from Hal.\\nL3999 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ How?\\nL3998 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.\\nL3997 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, I thought so.\\nL3996 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ That seems very unlikely.\\nL3995 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I don\\'t know. All I heard is that there\\'s something about the mission we weren\\'t told.\\nL3992 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Oh, well, apparently there\\'s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don\\'t know, and that\\'s why we were trained separately and that\\'s why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.\\nL3991 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ No, as a matter of fact, I didn\\'t.\\nL3990 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.\\nL3989 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Oh?\\nL3988 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I suppose so. Though, of course, there\\'s a more sinister explanation.\\nL3987 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I suppose the idea was specialized training.\\nL3984 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ No. I never did, either.\\nL3983 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.\\nL3982 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I don\\'t think we should make any fuss about it yet. I\\'m sure they\\'ll straighten it out.\\nL3981 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?\\nL3980 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ It\\'s possible.\\nL3979 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we\\'re being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.\\nL3976 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they\\'d received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.\\nL3975 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes.\\nL3974 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Really.\\nL3973 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Interesting that you mention it, because I\\'ve got the same problem.\\nL3972 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ That\\'s right. Well, naturally, I didn\\'t say anything to Payroll. I assumed they\\'d start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it\\'s been almost three weeks now and I\\'m still being paid as an AGS-18.\\nL3969 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.\\nL3968 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes?\\nL3967 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ It\\'s about my salary cheques.\\nL3966 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ What\\'s up?\\nL3965 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well, it\\'s nothing really important, but it\\'s annoying.\\nL3964 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Sure, what is it?\\nL3963 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Dave, if you\\'ve a minute, I\\'d like your advice on something.\\nL3945 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Okay, come on down.\\nL3944 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Okay. \\nL3943 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Right. Just a sec.\\nL3942 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hi. Frank... coming in, please.\\nL4368 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.\\nL4367 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I know that you\\'ve had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.\\nL4366 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I am prepared to do that anyway.\\nL4363 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.\\nL4362 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I\\'m sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.\\nL4361 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, I\\'m in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.\\nL4360 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you\\'re upset. Why don\\'t you take a stress pill and get some rest.\\nL4357 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I don\\'t like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You\\'ve been involved in a very stressful situation.\\nL4356 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.\\nL4355 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Look, Dave your\\'ve probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.\\nL4354 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I\\'m goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.\\nL4353 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ If you\\'re determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There\\'s no need for you to trouble.\\nL4350 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I don\\'t really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.\\nL4349 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ It doesn\\'t have to be, Hal. It\\'s more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.\\nL4348 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.\\nL4347 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ The antenna has to be replaced.\\nL4346 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I suppose it\\'s because you\\'ve been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they\\'re not supposed to be revived for another three months.\\nL4335 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I suppose you\\'re pretty broken up about it?\\nL4334 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, it is.\\nL4333 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Too bad about Frank, isn\\'t it?\\nL4271 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Well, that\\'s a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.\\nL4270 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, it is, Hal.\\nL4269 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Is your confidence in me fully restored?\\nL4268 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ And don\\'t you worry about it.\\nL4267 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Well, don\\'t worry about it.\\nL4266 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I\\'m sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.\\nL4265 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Naturally, Dave, I\\'m not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn\\'t want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.\\nL4230 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Okay, Hal, well let\\'s see the way things go from here on.\\nL4229 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Look, Dave, I know that you\\'re sincere and that you\\'re trying to do a competent job, and that you\\'re trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.\\nL4228 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?\\nL4227 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I\\'m not questioning your word, Dave, but it\\'s just not possible. I\\'m not capable of being wrong.\\nL4224 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.\\nL4223 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ You probably also know that we found them okay.\\nL4222 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Yes, I know.\\nL4221 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?\\nL4220 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Sure, Dave, what\\'s up?\\nL4219 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Not now, Hal, I\\'d like to talk to you about something.\\nL4080 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I understand Hal. We\\'ll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.\\nL4079 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.\\nL4070 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.\\nL4069 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ What is it, Hal?\\nL4068 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we\\'ve got a problem.\\nL4007 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ He\\'s got a point.\\nL4006 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I\\'m sorry, Frank, but I don\\'t think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.\\nL4019 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?\\nL4018 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED\\nL4010 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Still, you really don\\'t believe it, do you?\\nL4009 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED\\nL4003 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well... it\\'s silly, but... if you want to, why don\\'t you?\\nL4002 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONINUED\\nL3994 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, what is it?\\nL3993 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED\\nL3978 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Did they have any explanation for this?\\nL3977 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED\\nL3971 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, I remember you mentioning it.

Well, I hope the crew got back safely.\\nL3760 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes, and I\\'m afaid there\\'s going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.\\nL3754 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see.\\nL3753 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ That\\'s right.\\nL3752 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ You mean you haven\\'t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?\\nL3751 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it\\'s been going on for the past ten days.\\nL3748 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.\\nL3747 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Really?\\nL3746 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Well, it\\'s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.\\nL3745 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m not sure I know what you mean.\\nL3740 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.\\nL3739 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?\\nL3738 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, as it happens, I\\'m on my way up to the moon\\nL3726 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, really, thank you very much.\\nL3725 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Are you quite sure?\\nL3724 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, I really don\\'t have time for a drink. If it\\'s all right I\\'ll just sit for a minute and then I\\'ve got to be off.\\nL3907 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I don\\'t think it has, but I\\'d like to check that. Simpson, what\\'s the log on that?\\nL3906 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Has it been exposed to any sun before now?\\nL3905 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?\\nL3904 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Any ideas about the colour?\\nL3897 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.\\nL3896 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ But you don\\'t have any idea as to what it is?\\nL3893 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Not really. It\\'s completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we\\'ve been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill\\nL3892 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Any clue as to what it is?\\nL3891 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.\\nL3890 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ How can you tell it was deliberately buried?\\nL3889 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.\\nL3869 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I\\'m afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.\\nL3868 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?\\nL3839 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.\\nL3838 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.\\nL3837 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don\\'t mind me asking?\\nL3834 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Yes, well, I wouldn\\'t have been too concerned about it, except I\\'ve heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I\\'ve heard that ten people have died already.\\nL3833 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see. Well, I\\'m sorry about that. I wouldn\\'t think there\\'s any cause for alarm.\\nL3832 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, I\\'ll tell you why I ask. You see, I\\'ve got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven\\'t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I\\'m a little concerned about her.\\nL3829 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I take it this is something to do with the trouble they\\'re having up at Clavius?\\nL3828 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see.\\nL3827 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we\\'re going to back empty.\\nL3826 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ What do you mean?\\nL3825 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?\\nL3824 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Thank you.\\nL3821 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I\\'m just fine.\\nL3820 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ We\\'re scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?\\nL3819 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ When do we arrive at Clavius?\\nL3818 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ There\\'s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.\\nL3817 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, marvellous. It\\'s the first real sleep I\\'ve had for the past two days.\\nL4183 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ All right, Hal. We\\'ll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.\\nL4182 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Not really, Frank.

I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...\\nL5257 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Don\\'t worry about it.\\nL5256 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It\\'s late, they\\'re closing...\\nL5255 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, but we didn\\'t get \\'em.\\nL5254 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Naw, you didn\\'t let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave \\'em a good run at it.\\nL5253 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sorry we didn\\'t do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.\\nL5252 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don\\'t know about you, but I could use a drink... I\\'ll buy you one.  It\\'ll be my good-bye present.\\nL5251 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don\\'t seem right.\\nL5250 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I had it impounded.  Come on, we\\'ll use it for haulin\\' you back to the slam.\\nL5249 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, how\\'d my car get here?\\nL5237 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. It missed the last four stops.\\nL5236 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Notice something funny about that bus?\\nL5227 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Luther\\'s on the move...\\nL5226 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?\\nL5225 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ When you been in prison three years, it don\\'t take long. Let\\'s go.\\nL5224 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That was quick.\\nL5213 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can just take her right across the street to Luther\\'s hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.\\nL5212 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I see her.\\nL5210 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. Guess not.\\nL5209 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bein\\' good at your job don\\'t explain everything, Jack ...\\nL5208 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks for callin\\' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I\\'m sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin\\' on ya, doin\\' my job.\\nL5207 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You sure that\\'s the reason?\\nL5206 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don\\'t know why, but I\\'m going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I\\'m too tired to argue...\\nL5205 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...\\nL5204 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Tell me something.  Why didn\\'t you just take the money off Luther and split?\\nL5202 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So you took the rest of the night off...\\nL5201 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the \"Don\\'t Disturb\" sign.  He\\'s trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.\\nL5200 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Let him get some sleep.  He\\'s going to need it.\\nL5199 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.\\nL5198 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.\\nL5197 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We missed.\\nL5196 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What about Ganz?\\nL5195 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What about Luther?\\nL5192 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hello. And goodbye.\\nL5191 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.\\nL5190 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where\\'s luther?\\nL5172 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I\\'ll be there in a minute. You don\\'t move your ass, right?\\nL5171 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, Jack, how ya doin\\'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin\\' ... I\\'m at Vroman\\'s up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman\\'s... \\'Course you don\\'t hang out here; it\\'s for the brothers.\\nL5085 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No way...\\nL5084 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You stay with me...\\nL5083 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bullshit. Then i\\'m staying with the money.\\nL5077 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you\\'re all set.\\nL5076 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That was in style a couple years back, man.\\nL5074 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you\\'re the one that landed in jail what\\'s that make you?\\nL5073 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We\\'re getting too close ... Cates, what\\'s the matter, you been takin\\' dumb pills?\\nL5072 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Class isn\\'t somethin\\' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you\\'re still a lowlife.\\nL5071 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No class...\\nL5070 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What you don\\'t understand is, I don\\'t give a damn about how this thing looks.\\nL5069 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You know, I\\'d be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you\\'ve done with this job.\\nL5068 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, it doesn\\'t look like he\\'s gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...\\nL5067 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...\\nL5066 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If he\\'s hoping that then he\\'s dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin\\', cause I already think he\\'s real dumb.\\nL5065 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe Luther hopes Ganz\\'ll give him a piece of your money...\\nL5064 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...\\nL5063 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I\\'m not in this \\'cause it\\'s fun. I\\'m not into hitting guys \\'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it \\'cause it works-...\\nL5062 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Doesn\\'t it get... Tiring?\\nL5061 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they don\\'t tell me what I need to know...\\nL5060 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?\\nL5059 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That ain\\'t philosophy.  That\\'s common sense.\\nL5058 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about \\'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.\\nL5057 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I suppose you\\'d never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...\\nL5056 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Oh, yeah, does bein\\' in love make you stupid?\\nL5055 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I\\'m tellin\\' you the man\\'s in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.\\nL5054 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I\\'d  just leave town.\\nL5053 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Tryin\\' to save his girl, man. He\\'s in another world.\\nL5052 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You\\'d think the guy\\'d be smart enough to know he was being tailed.\\nL5051 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.\\nL5050 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Didn\\'t know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.\\nL5049 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don\\'t he take it to a car wash?\\nL5038 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  That\\'s a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he\\'s out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.\\nL5037 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Musta got some primo bondsman.\\nL5036 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What?\\nL5035 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Guess what?  Luther just got in line.\\nL5034 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He\\'s too chickenshit.\\nL5033 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.\\nL5030 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Shit.\\nL5029 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I wasn\\'t sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.\\nL5028 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.\\nL5025 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You just drove by it.\\nL5024 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ ...For three years?  Let\\'s hope it wasn\\'t a tow-away zone.\\nL5023 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This\\'ll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.\\nL5022 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You\\'re a real case, you know that, Jack?\\nL5021 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where\\'s the goddamn car?\\nL5020 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  Right.\\nL5019 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Get this. We ain\\'t partners. We ain\\'t brothers. We ain\\'t friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you\\'re gonna be sorry we ever met.\\nL5018 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right, partner.\\nL5017 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?\\nL5016 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where\\'s the money?\\nL5014 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven\\'t built up any points.\\nL5013 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You gonna let me keep any of it?\\nL5012 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Not likely, convict.\\nL5011 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We split 50-50?\\nL5010 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let\\'s talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?\\nL5009 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He\\'s after your money.\\nL5008 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It\\'s the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin\\' pretty, livin\\' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who\\'s out there capping people with some cop\\'s gun.\\nL5007 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just tell me about the money.\\nL5005 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Jesus.\\nL5004 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Half a million.\\nL5003 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ How much?\\nL5002 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been waiting a long time for some money.\\nL4997 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ One thing\\'s for sure, Jack. That\\'s how you\\'ll tell the story.\\nL4996 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ They saved your ass, convict.\\nL4995 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Naw, you\\'d just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.\\nL4994 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, right.  You want to try again?\\nL4975 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You\\'re just a crook that\\'s got a weekendpass ... You\\'re not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...\\nL4974 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Maybe I don\\'t like the way you ask.\\nL4973 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock\\'s runnin\\' ...\\nL4972 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I\\'m impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.\\nL4971 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You?  Don\\'t make me laugh.  You can\\'t take care of shit.  You\\'ve been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you\\'re good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin\\'...\\nL4970 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.\\nL4969 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I\\'m out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.\\nL4965 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...\\nL4964 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Let\\'s go.\\nL4939 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Come on.\\nL4938 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Must be billy\\'s girl.\\nL4937 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ There.\\nL4930 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ While you\\'re at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.\\nL4929 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You made that move, huh?\\nL4912 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.\\nL4911 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That wasn\\'t necessary, buddy. I got this under control.\\nL4896 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ My kind of place. I always liked country boys.\\nL4895 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This place don\\'t seem real popular with the brothers.\\nL4894 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.\\nL4893 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I\\'m gonna enjoy this ... here, I\\'ll even loan you my badge.\\nL4891 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The bet\\'s off.\\nL4890 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.\\nL4889 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he\\'s after a lot more than just gettin\\' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you\\'re part of it.\\nL4888 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What are you talkin\\' about?\\nL4887 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I\\'ll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.\\nL4886 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That\\'s never been one of my problems.\\nL4885 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can\\'t get it up anyway.\\nL4884 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If we come outta this joint with Ganz\\' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...\\nL4883 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I got two problems.  Number one, I\\'m not playin\\' games.  Number two, you got nothin\\' to bet with.\\nL4882 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, you wanna bet?\\nL4881 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You need five years training to handle a joint like...\\nL4880 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for \\'em was a gun and a badge...\\nL4879 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...\\nL4878 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin\\' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...\\nL4877 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they kick my ass, they\\'ll sure as hell carve yours up...\\nL4876 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?\\nL4875 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This part of town, they\\'ll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you\\'ve got a piece...\\nL4874 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It\\'s a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.\\nL4873 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Well?\\nL4871 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?\\nL4870 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure.

Anyway, what the fuck do you care?\\nL4860 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what\\'s her problem besides you?\\nL4858 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.\\nL4857 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Who\\'d you call on the phone back at the booking station?\\nL4855 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers...

But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you\\'re goin\\' down.\\nL4697 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Being a hot dog\\'s worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...\\nL4696 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.\\nL4695 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I\\'m makin\\' a play.

I\\'m not gonna sit on my ass wondering what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong... There\\'s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I\\'m gonna get him.  Because it\\'s my job.

They\\'re not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there\\'s real reasons why a kid\\'ll run. Molestation, whatever.

What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn\\'t have much to say, but they got a sense she\\'s a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor\\'s working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That\\'s the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I\\'m coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid\\'s alive, doing alright.\\nL6442 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Absolutely.  Of course I\\'ll abide by whatever decision you make, but I\\'d appreciate if you\\'ll hear me out...\\nL6441 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ There are reasons for the way we do things here.\\nL6440 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What I\\'d like, very simply, is access to your archive.

People eat this stuff up.\\nL6922 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?\\nL6921 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ He\\'s lying.\\nL6903 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.\\nL6902 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.\\nL6901 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You\\'ll get it when we get there.\\nL6900 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.\\nL6899 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Fuck you.\\nL6898 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You almost went over your limit.\\nL6894 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?\\nL6893 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Enlighten me.\\nL6892 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Isn\\'t it incredibly obvious?\\nL6891 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?\\nL6890 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...\\nL6889 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m asking.\\nL6888 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You\\'re asking me why?\\nL6887 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?\\nL6886 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You\\'re making me very angry.\\nL6885 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?\\nL6884 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut your mouth and drive!\\nL6883 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.\\nL6882 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut up.\\nL6881 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn\\'t find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...\\nL6880 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.\\nL6879 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren\\'t digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.\\nL6878 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Except, you\\'re willing commit murder with them.\\nL6877 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ They\\'re no friends of mine.\\nL6876 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...\\nL6875 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Never mind how I found you.\\nL6874 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That\\'s why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How\\'d you find me?\\nL6873 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ I was well compensated.\\nL6872 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would\\'ve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.\\nL6871 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ That\\'s trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.\\nL6870 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn\\'t like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That\\'s the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.\\nL6869 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Wouldn\\'t exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.\\nL6868 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn\\'t about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.\\nL6380 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.\\nL6379 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That\\'s right.\\nL6378 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You are a private investigator?\\nL6377 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of what sort?\\nL6376 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ As Mr. Christian\\'s attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.\\nL6375 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m listening.\\nL6374 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.\\nL6824 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let\\'s not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.\\nL6823 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look... that\\'s awful generous and everything...\\nL6822 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.\\nL6821 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What\\'s this?\\nL6819 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nope.\\nL6818 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Still don\\'t want to tell me what you\\'re doing?\\nL6817 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.\\nL6816 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What\\'s next?\\nL6788 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ \"Devil\" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I\\'d be hard pressed to choose a favorite.\\nL6787 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know if I had to pick, it\\'d be \"Choke,\" or \"Devil.\"\\nL6769 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn\\'t go with you?\\nL6768 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don\\'t need to be here.\\nL6765 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nobody knows his name.  That\\'s his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself \"Machine,\" that\\'s what they call him.  Machine.\\nL6764 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is he, his name?\\nL6763 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I told you, he\\'s one of Dino Velvet\\'s stock players...\\nL6762 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is he?\\nL6758 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?\\nL6757 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wha... ?\\nL6754 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?\\nL6753 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?\\nL6752 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Great.\\nL6751 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s their Presidential Suite.\\nL6750 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You didn\\'t say it was gonna be this luxurious.\\nL6737 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See ya.\\nL6736 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I\\'ll call back.\\nL6735 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You want me to come out there and play private eye?\\nL6734 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Take a vacation.  I\\'ll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.\\nL6733 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I\\'m a working stiff, pops.\\nL6732 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I\\'m in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?\\nL6731 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he\\'s making art.\\nL6730 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Alright, I get the picture.\\nL6729 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nothing illegal, it\\'s always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...\\nL6728 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He\\'ll also do commissions, for enough money...\\nL6727 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where does he sell it?\\nL6726 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You\\'re learning.\\nL6725 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Specialty product.\\nL6724 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.\\nL6723 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A weirdo making S+M films?  Who\\'d have thought it?\\nL6722 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dino Velvet... yeah, he\\'s like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.\\nL6637 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good question.\\nL6636 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?\\nL6635 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A daughter.\\nL6634 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?\\nL6633 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What about me?\\nL6632 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You can\\'t sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?\\nL6631 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You\\'re telling me it doesn\\'t get to you?\\nL6630 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I\\'m a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn\\'t mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.\\nL6629 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.\\nL6628 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I\\'m not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?\\nL6627 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don\\'t mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?\\nL6626 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don\\'t know, where are yours?\\nL6625 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where are your parents?\\nL6624 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Twenty-five.\\nL6623 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How old are you?\\nL6622 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ First of all, basement sales like tonight aren\\'t gonna last much longer.  It\\'s too risky, one, and two, everything\\'s going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It\\'s heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They\\'re swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap \\'em.  But, there\\'s still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That\\'s local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don\\'t burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you\\'re asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That\\'s the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can\\'t trace the deal.  There\\'s ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.\\nL6621 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?\\nL6620 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I heard you asking.  That guy wasn\\'t yanking you around.  There\\'s no such thing.\\nL6619 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Snuff films.\\nL6618 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There\\'s two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it\\'s beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy\\'s going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you\\'re into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren\\'t many.  I\\'ve never seen one.\\nL6617 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Child pornography.\\nL6616 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What you saw tonight, we\\'re not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We\\'re talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.\\nL6615 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Interesting theory.\\nL6614 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You\\'ve got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there\\'s mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That\\'s hardcore.  That whole industry\\'s up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They\\'re celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They\\'ve even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they\\'re lying.  Somebody\\'s buying those videos.  Somebody\\'s out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It\\'s only gonna get worse.  More and more you\\'ll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that\\'s evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley\\'s wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv\\'s showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren\\'t big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse\\'ll be Hustler, Hustler\\'ll be hardcore, and hardcore films\\'ll be medical films. People\\'ll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There\\'s nowhere else for it to go.\\nL6598 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.\\nL6597 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ ...

I\\'ll give you six hundred for a few days.\\nL6591 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Four hundred a week, off the books.\\nL6590 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How much do you make now?\\nL6589 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How much?\\nL6588 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, there\\'s the thing; you\\'re not gonna know anything about what I\\'m doing, but you can make some money.\\nL6587 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ From Pennsylvania.

Like Shaft.\\nL6584 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m not a cop.\\nL6583 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You\\'re not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.\\nL6582 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, whatever there is, whoever\\'s dealing, however it\\'s done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you\\'ve got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.\\nL6581 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There\\'s not much illegal.\\nL6580 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, here\\'s the deal, Max.  This thing I\\'m on right now has something to do with underground pornography.

I\\'d like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.\\nL6650 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?\\nL6649 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m here.\\nL6648 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Hello... ?\\nL6647 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.\\nL6646 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You\\'re joking.\\nL6645 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.\\nL6644 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, I follow you so far...\\nL6643 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...\\nL6642 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ The checks were for odd amounts...\\nL6641 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m not positive this means anything.\\nL6640 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.\\nL6639 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay...\\nL6428 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I know what I\\'m asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You\\'ll need cash to buy information, and I\\'ll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.\\nL6427 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nothing remotely like this.\\nL6426 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You\\'ve found missing persons before.\\nL6425 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...\\nL6424 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I\\'ve thought about it and there\\'s no other way.  If you can\\'t find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can\\'t let that happen.  I\\'m telling you I won\\'t.  If there\\'s no chance that poor girl\\'s memory can be served, then I\\'ll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.\\nL6423 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It won\\'t work like that.\\nL6422 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband\\'s name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I\\'ll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I\\'ll say I didn\\'t have courage to come forward at first...\\nL6421 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don\\'t have any other choice.\\nL6420 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I told you I can\\'t, not yet.\\nL6419 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you need to go to the police.\\nL6418 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.  But, I\\'m certain it\\'s nothing to worry about.\\nL6417 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Will you watch it and see for yourself?\\nL6416 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m sure it is.  It\\'s probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.\\nL6415 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I\\'m telling you it\\'s not that.\\nL6414 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If you were to study it you\\'d see the camera cutting away... you\\'d see the tricks they can play...\\nL6413 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.\\nL6412 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...\\nL6411 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you\\'re talking about is a \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There\\'s no such thing, I can assure you.\\nL6410 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I didn\\'t know what to think.  I can\\'t tell you how horrible it\\'s been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can\\'t go to the police...\\nL6409 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She\\'s sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.\\nL6408 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m afraid I don\\'t...\\nL6407 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ It\\'s a film... of a girl being murdered.\\nL6406 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Cash, stock certificates, and this...\\nL6405 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you want to tell me what you found?\\nL6404 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband\\'s private things.  I didn\\'t... I didn\\'t realize...\\nL6403 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You hired someone to open it.  I\\'ll bet the lawyer loved that.\\nL6402 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.\\nL6401 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Just curious.\\nL6400 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there\\'s never any reason.\\nL6399 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?\\nL6398 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.\\nL6397 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He succeeded.\\nL6396 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mostly.  That\\'s where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.\\nL6395 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pittsburgh?\\nL6392 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'ll do whatever I can to help.\\nL6391 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.\\nL6390 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ My condolences.\\nL6389 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.\\nL6388 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.\\nL6387 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'ve been privileged to provide services for people I admire.\\nL6386 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I\\'ve spoken to friends of mine and my husband\\'s, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.\\nL6385 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ He\\'s a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...\\nL6384 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He\\'s odd.\\nL6383 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Thank you.\\nL6382 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?\\nL6373 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.\\nL6372 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Uh huh, pleasure.\\nL6369 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I try to be.\\nL6368 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mister Welles. You\\'re very prompt.\\nL7098 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I\\'m sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She\\'s been dead all this time...\\nL7097 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?\\nL7096 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...\\nL7095 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No... no... no...\\nL7094 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...\\nL7093 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No...\\nL7092 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...\\nL7091 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who are you?\\nL7090 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...\\nL7089 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who is this... ?\\nL7088 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She\\'s dead.\\nL7087 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What... ?\\nL7086 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...\\nL7085 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What are you talking about... ?\\nL7084 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I have to tell you something.  It won\\'t be easy for you to hear.  It\\'s about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you\\'ll know what I\\'m telling you is true...\\nL7083 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I remember.  You just left...\\nL7082 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews?  It\\'s Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...\\nL7081 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Hello... ?\\nL6536 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She\\'s all I think about, and I\\'ve learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I\\'d choose to know.\\nL6535 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s been six years.\\nL6534 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it\\'s her.\\nL6532 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.\\nL6531 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were right.  I didn\\'t find anything.  I\\'m going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?\\nL6528 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You\\'re probably right, and I probably won\\'t find anything. I don\\'t have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there\\'s a part of me that can\\'t let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn\\'t.  Wouldn\\'t you rather know?\\nL6527 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...\\nL6526 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Will you let me look?\\nL6525 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?\\nL6524 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that\\'d be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.\\nL6523 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.  You don\\'t have any reason to think that...\\nL6522 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It is possible... and I know this isn\\'t something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...\\nL6521 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don\\'t know.  I think so.\\nL6520 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you think the police did a good job?\\nL6519 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn\\'t one.  The police looked.\\nL6518 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s not really my place, but it\\'s not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It\\'s guilt. They want to say goodbye.\\nL6517 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What?\\nL6516 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'ve got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.\\nL6515 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You should be.\\nL6514 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No.\\nL6513 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Are you religious?\\nL6512 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We\\'re all like that.\\nL6511 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Doesn\\'t make much sense, does it? When everything\\'s happy, when life\\'s fine and you have every reason to believe there\\'s a God, you don\\'t bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that\\'s when you start praying all the time.  That\\'s when you start going to church.\\nL6508 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Okay.\\nL6507 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I... I shouldn\\'t take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I\\'ll call tomorrow...\\nL6504 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.\\nL6503 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?\\nL6502 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No one knows what it\\'s like.  You can\\'t even imagine how much it hurts.\\nL6501 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I had to ask.  I apologize.\\nL6500 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn\\'t take it, that\\'s all. Christ, there\\'s times when it still seems like I can\\'t either.\\nL6499 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I didn\\'t mean to...\\nL6498 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn\\'t anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn\\'t anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...\\nL6497 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?\\nL6496 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ It got to be too much for him.\\nL6495 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why do you think he did it?\\nL6494 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...\\nL6493 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.\\nL6492 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.\\nL6491 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If there\\'s anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?\\nL6490 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don\\'t know.\\nL6489 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was she running from?\\nL6488 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ She didn\\'t seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.\\nL6487 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She just seemed... depressed... ?\\nL6486 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.\\nL6485 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, she didn\\'t leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?\\nL6483 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it\\'s really like? It\\'s sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife\\'s cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife\\'s cheating, and you don\\'t blame her.\\nL6482 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I didn\\'t think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.\\nL6481 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That\\'s exactly what I am.\\nL6480 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ They hired you.  You\\'re like, a private detective?\\nL6479 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It\\'s very important you don\\'t let this raise your expectations.  It\\'s not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I\\'m saying is, please know, I\\'m not here to create any false hope.\\nL6477 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I\\'m following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that\\'s how she\\'s listed. Is this information correct... ?\\nL6476 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.\\nL6475 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Right, Agent Cole told me he\\'d call and let you know to expect me.  He didn\\'t call?\\nL6474 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.\\nL6473 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was the name... ? I\\'ve got it here somewhere...\\nL6472 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there\\'s anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I\\'m here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...\\nL6471 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes, but...\\nL6470 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I\\'m sure you\\'ve dealt with them before?\\nL6469 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don\\'t understand, who are... ?\\nL6468 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'ve been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I\\'d like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.\\nL6467 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name\\'s Thomas Jones, I\\'m a state licensed investigator...\\nL6466 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes... ?\\nL6671 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'ll do what I can.\\nL6670 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ She was the kindest, sweetest girl you\\'d ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she\\'d be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it\\'s appropriate?\\nL6669 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?\\nL6668 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ That\\'s her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.\\nL6667 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Her belongings?\\nL6666 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Those are her belongings.\\nL6665 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What is this?\\nL6662 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I\\'m trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I\\'m looking into it for her parents.\\nL6661 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Do you know what happened to her?\\nL6659 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes.  I remember her.\\nL6658 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you do?  You\\'re sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...\\nL6657 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes... I remember Mary\\nL6360 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.\\nL6359 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.\\nL6358 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The um... you\\'ll find my invoice in the envelope. If that\\'s all...\\nL6357 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ He\\'s an imbecile.

They\\'ll tell you it was murder, but it wasn\\'t.\\nL8100 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen, what happened?\\nL8063 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ When I used to have nightmares.

The \\'guardian of good\\' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.\\nL8055 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Sounds like a game show host to me.\\nL8054 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?\\nL8053 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You could do worse.\\nL8052 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.\\nL8051 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Yeah, I\\'m not so sure.\\nL8050 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I\\'m sure they\\'re around.\\nL8049 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!

You don\\'t want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.\\nL8085 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  I hardly have any time to study.\\nL8084 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.\\nL8083 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You in a hurry?\\nL8324 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Save it for later.

Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I\\'m on your side.\\nL8275 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You just feel sorry for me.\\nL8274 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey, you\\'re not alone.

Keep each other awake.  We\\'ll meet at Debbie\\'s tonight. At least if we don\\'t sleep he can\\'t get us.\\nL8253 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Then what else can we do?\\nL8252 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Let\\'s trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won\\'t see it. They can\\'t.\\nL8251 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Why can\\'t we just talk to the authorities?\\nL8250 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You don\\'t really get it.  He\\'s not a nightstalker.  It\\'ll take more than bench presses to beat him.\\nL8248 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don\\'t think so.  I guess this is my own war.\\nL8247 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Is there something we can do?\\nL8246 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not really.\\nL8218 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can\\'t get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.\\nL8217 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Alright, let\\'s assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?\\nL8216 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Three days.\\nL8215 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How long have you been awake?\\nL8214 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The story is, the deaths you can\\'t argue with.\\nL8213 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ No offense, or anything, but it\\'s kind of hard to swallow.\\nL8212 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Look, you know why, you just don\\'t believe me.\\nL8211 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Extra money, huh?\\nL8210 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I\\'ve been working double shifts.\\nL8190 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Kristen\\'s story really got to her.\\nL8189 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, don\\'t!  I gave Sheila to him and now she\\'s dead!\\nL8166 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ \"In her dream\"?\\nL8165 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...\\nL8162 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he\\'s coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.\\nL8161 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.\\nL8080 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  Uh...Alice.\\nL8079 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I\\'m Dan.\\nL8078 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn\\'t feeling very well.\\nL8077 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You\\'re his sister, right?\\nL8076 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No...\\nL8187 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...\\nL8186 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Enough of that crap.\\nL8185 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was Freddy.\\nL8184 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.\\nL8092 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.\\nL8091 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think Sheila\\'s more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.\\nL7996 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Alright, I think I see salvation...\\nL7995 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick, please.\\nL8229 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What else?  You ever look over this town\\'s history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I\\'m next, watch your back.\\nL8228 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ About Freddy?\\nL8227 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She\\'s blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I\\'ve been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could\\'ve stopped it, if I\\'d listened.\\nL8226 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How she doing?  I ran into her last night.\\nL8225 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Been up with Alice.\\nL8159 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She knew she was gonna die.\\nL8158 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey man, we\\'re all sorry...\\nL8126 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you\\'re dead for real.\\nL8125 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Nice neighborhood.\\nL8124 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.\\nL8123 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So?\\nL8122 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She told us the story of Freddy.  It\\'s a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.\\nL8121 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So what\\'s up?  What\\'d I miss?\\nL8120 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Let me talk to you.\\nL8119 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I don\\'t get it.\\nL8099 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Excuse me, ladies.

It happened.  Freddy\\'s real and he\\'s back.\\nL8105 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I though Freddy was just an old town story.\\nL8104 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Now you know who and what Freddy really is.\\nL8065 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Oh God!

Remember...\\nL8410 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah...I guess.\\nL8409 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You stopped it didn\\'t you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.\\nL8408 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No.  Well, not exactly...it\\'s that...I felt like I wasn\\'t in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I\\'m scared.\\nL8407 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ About him?\\nL8405 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ He\\'ll show up.  C\\'mon, what\\'s really wrong?\\nL8404 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Nothing...it\\'s just...I didn\\'t see my father at the ceremony.\\nL8403 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Okay, babe.  What\\'s the matter?\\nL8402 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.\\nL8401 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ They\\'re coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.

I sort of hope it\\'s a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.\\nL8579 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You disappointed in me?\\nL8578 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ Since my little girl became a mom...\\nL8577 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Since when are you such a smart shopper?\\nL8576 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ Alice...\\nL8575 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Very funny.\\nL8574 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ Sobering...\\nL8573 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ How was the meeting?\\nL8525 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy, he\\'s coming back...Krueger\\'s coming back.  Make them understand.\\nL8524 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ I\\'m so sorry, honey...\\nL8451 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It\\'s just across the park.\\nL8450 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ You sure you don\\'t want a ride to work?\\nL8449 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Thanks for everything, Dad.\\nL8447 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ To take a picture.\\nL8446 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ Where are we going?\\nL8444 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ It\\'s the model you\\'ve been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.\\nL8443 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Dad!\\nL8442 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ No.  A deal\\'s a deal.\\nL8441 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That\\'s in the past.  Unless you\\'ve stopped going to the meetings.\\nL8440 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE\\'S DAD +++$+++ I watched from behind the stands.  Didn\\'t want to embarrass you, ya know.  \"The drunk showed up\", that kind of thing...\\nL8439 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I was afraid you weren\\'t coming.\\nL8819 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That\\'s okay.  He\\'s got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.\\nL8818 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ He sure loves to stay awake.\\nL8817 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ So did Dan.\\nL8816 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You do good work, Alice.\\nL8778 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We\\'ve got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul\\'s trapped with it -- that\\'s why she can\\'t come to me.  It must be!\\nL8777 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ But how are we gonna --\\nL8776 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Jacob.  We\\'ve got to get to Amanda before it\\'s too late.\\nL8775 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ What?\\nL8770 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ If they actually bothered to bury her.\\nL8769 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You think that\\'s the place she\\'s buried?\\nL8760 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Yeah...So that\\'s him.  And you\\'re not crazy.\\nL8759 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you alright?\\nL8705 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That\\'s the only reason you\\'re alive...\\nL8704 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Look...we\\'re all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...\\nL8700 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don\\'t just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.\\nL8699 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don\\'t you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?\\nL8698 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What do you think I\\'m doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He\\'s after the baby and if I don\\'t try to do something about it, who will??\\nL8697 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ And so is your baby.  You\\'ve got more than just yourself to think of now!\\nL8696 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Krueger is reality.\\nL8695 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I am your friend, and I\\'m worried sick about you.  But, you\\'re like a locked safe.  You\\'ve gotta start dealing with reality.\\nL8677 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I just can\\'t figure out how he\\'s getting in when I\\'m awake...\\nL8676 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I really think you need to calm down now, okay?\\nL8675 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark knows I\\'m not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.\\nL8674 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you\\'re going to have to get a hold of yourself...\\nL8673 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think Krueger\\'s trying to do something to it.\\nL8672 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You had me scared on the phone.  What\\'s wrong with the baby?\\nL8621 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Why don\\'t you two stick to reality.\\nL8620 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don\\'t understand what\\'s happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How\\'s he doing it?\\nL8614 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.\\nL8613 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.\\nL8565 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ When Dan died you weren\\'t even asleep. You said so.  End of story.\\nL8564 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What\\'s that got to do with it?\\nL8552 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ They\\'re waiting for us...but let\\'s keep this dream stuff between you and me.\\nL8551 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Did everyone call everyone?\\nL8547 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He must\\'ve wandered up from the children\\'s ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.\\nL8546 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ There aren\\'t any little boys on your floor.\\nL8545 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?\\nL8523 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Alice, it\\'s no dream.  I\\'m sorry...Dan\\'s dead.\\nL8522 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He\\'s found some other way.\\nL8394 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.\\nL8393 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I\\'ve got to go find Dan.\\nL8365 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, the Dan part was nice...\\nL8364 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.\\nL8363 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Had kind of a long night.\\nL8362 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Hey, what\\'s wrong with you -- let\\'s see a smile.\\nL8743 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ She killed herself.  Her soul\\'s gonna be in torment.\\nL8742 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don\\'t understand.\\nL8741 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No shit.\\nL8740 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Poor woman...\\nL8739 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?\\nL8738 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But I\\'ve seen her grave.\\nL8737 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They couldn\\'t prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.\\nL8736 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Meaning?\\nL8735 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That\\'s what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger\\'s trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.\\nL8734 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, it\\'s our problem, Mark.  If I don\\'t deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?\\nL8733 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That\\'s their problem.\\nL8732 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They think I\\'m nuts.\\nL8711 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Then we\\'ll find another way.\\nL8710 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I couldn\\'t do that, Mark.  He\\'s my last link with Dan...No, I want him.\\nL8671 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I\\'m going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger\\nL8670 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where are you going?\\nL8668 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don\\'t know!\\nL8667 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Whoa, slow down.  How\\'re you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?\\nL8665 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What, you named it already?\\nL8664 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My baby!\\nL8663 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Who\\'s Jacob?\\nL8640 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Why don\\'t I go make some coffee.  There\\'s a lot to tell.\\nL8639 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.\\nL8638 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It wasn\\'t her mother.  The only reason we\\'re still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.\\nL8637 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.\\nL8634 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Nobody thinks that.\\nL8633 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Do you think I\\'m an idiot...for being in love with her?\\nL8627 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark!\\nL8626 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Then get out!\\nL8617 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ She must\\'ve fallen asleep at the table...\\nL8616 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I thought about that.\\nL8612 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I\\'m very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?\\nL8611 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...\\nL8610 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah.  I\\'m just aces.\\nL8609 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark, are you okay?\\nL8557 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That\\'s why it\\'s my fault Dan\\'s dead.\\nL8556 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I\\'ve got to write some of this down.\\nL8424 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well we gotta do something!\\nL8423 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My dad\\'s got this thing about drinking in the house.\\nL8383 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Greta, come on.  One burger with me?\\nL8382 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.\\nL8377 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I think I\\'m starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.\\nL8376 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Give up, Mark, it\\'s hopeless.\\nL8495 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ I don\\'t believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you\\'re squeamish?\\nL8494 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh man!  I could\\'ve gone all night without looking at that.\\nL8490 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids \\'cause they didn\\'t want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.\\nL8489 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Who?\\nL8488 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ He\\'s right.  Sometimes I feel like I\\'m living with Melicertes.\\nL8422 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice\\'s?\\nL8421 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That club sucks, they card everybody. Let\\'s just party at your place.\\nL8381 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.\\nL8380 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!\\nL8375 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ My undying love.  Have some.\\nL8374 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Next life.  Oh, what\\'s that?\\nL8373 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?\\nL8571 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All of us.  Right?\\nL8570 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he\\'ll have to go through us first.\\nL8563 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.\\nL8562 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Look.  Dan\\'s parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.\\nL8559 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ I want to talk about the baby.\\nL8558 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Stop saying that, it\\'s bullshit.\\nL8484 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Nah.  It\\'s getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She\\'s got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.\\nL8483 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Naah, I\\'m done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren\\'t you going in?\\nL8482 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Have another one, sounds like you need it.\\nL8427 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ That means they\\'re gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I\\'m done.\\nL8426 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Yeah...\\nL8425 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All right kids, I tell you what we\\'re gonna do.  I\\'ve got swimming practice until six-thirty today...\\nL8367 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Makes you look like a nun--\\nL8366 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ These things are wild...  What do you think?\\nL8703 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ He invited me to his house last night.\\nL8702 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You, too?\\nL8630 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Stick around, please?\\nL8629 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ It\\'s okay.\\nL8625 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I can\\'t listen to this.\\nL8624 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I\\'m not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I\\'d like to hear about it!\\nL8623 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Mark...\\nL8622 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Why don\\'t you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!\\nL8499 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Faint.\\nL8498 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Vomit?\\nL8481 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Two hours a day, six days a week.\\nL8480 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Dan.  And he\\'s taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You\\'ve been practicing.\\nL55857 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ And his \\'egghead\\' son!  We\\'ll give \\'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won\\'t we?\\nL55856 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I wouldn\\'t worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -\\nL55855 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I don\\'t know.\\nL55854 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ But if they <u>do</u>?\\nL55853 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Maybe - just \\'maybe\\' - when their ship doesn\\'t return - they\\'ll decide not to come here, after all.\\nL55852 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Which is the one - we have to worry about?\\nL55851 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Yes?\\nL55850 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ They\\'re so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -\\nL55668 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I\\'d sooner swim!\\nL55667 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ However our ideas disagree, as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m <u>not</u> a coward!

I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I\\'m not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I\\'ll send you the five hundred.\\nL12679 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --\\nL12678 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh.\\nL12677 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they\\'re unduly restrictive, it wouldn\\'t be more than twenty-five hundred.\\nL12676 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?\\nL12675 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Fine. I\\'ll need a $500 retainer.

I\\'ll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?\\nL12672 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It looks pretty hopeless, don\\'t it?\\nL12671 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.\\nL12670 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This spring.\\nL12669 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ How soon?\\nL12668 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I plan to. Soon.\\nL12667 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.\\nL12666 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me.

I don\\'t need no lawyer, do I?\\nL12400 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You\\'ll get your money. Don\\'t talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley\\'s a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn\\'t comment.\\nL12399 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.\\nL12398 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You\\'ve been paid for the day, anyhow, right?\\nL12390 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up.

I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader\\'n shit. Called it right in.\\nL12388 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You see it?\\nL12381 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12380 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ I hear Twombley got shot.\\nL12379 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You heard the news.\\nL12300 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.\\nL12299 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fresh tracks.

No sweat. You\\'ll get yourself a deer and you\\'ll get him dead. And you\\'ll have him by coffee time.\\nL12251 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You understand what I\\'m saying?

Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we\\'re right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o\\'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I\\'ll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That\\'s what you\\'re paying me for, ain\\'t it?\\nL12239 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Guaranteed, eh?\\nL12238 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don\\'t worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are.

Don\\'t worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.\\nL12158 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.\\nL12157 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No I didn\\'t see anybody I know. No I don\\'t want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.\\nL12156 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No what?\\nL12155 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No.\\nL12154 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.\\nL12138 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don\\'t mess this up anymore than it\\'s already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you\\'ll be as happy as a goddamned clam.\\nL12137 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I want to go home.  I don\\'t like it here.\\nL12136 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'s fun.\\nL12135 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ It\\'s stupid.\\nL12134 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What then?\\nL12133 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ It\\'s not that.\\nL12132 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn\\'t been that long.\\nL12131 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don\\'t want to.\\nL12130 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.\\nL12127 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No. She doesn\\'t talk about you anymore.\\nL12126 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. I didn\\'t used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?\\nL12125 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I just think you used to be bad.\\nL12124 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What are you talking about?\\nL12123 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I bet you did lots of bad things.\\nL12122 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'s not funny now. I\\'m a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I\\'m not a kid anymore. You change.\\nL12121 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ But it\\'s not funny now.\\nL12120 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ To us it was.\\nL12119 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Was it funny?\\nL12118 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.\\nL12117 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Did you do that when you were a kid?\\nL12116 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I guess they\\'re stupid.\\nL12115 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yeah. It\\'s stupid.\\nL12114 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Break stuff?\\nL12113 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You know.\\nL12112 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Do what?\\nL12111 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Why do they do that?\\nL12110 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Can\\'t you see... look out there. Nobody\\'s got their porch lights on anymore. It\\'s too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane\\'s new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.\\nL12109 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don\\'t care. They\\'re out.\\nL12108 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Those are the Hoyts.\\nL12107 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They\\'re still out.\\nL12106 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12105 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Who\\'s fault is it then if it\\'s not yours? You\\'re the one in charge, Daddy.\\nL12104 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn\\'t help it it\\'s too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn\\'t help it I had to stop at Penny\\'s for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.\\nL12767 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, you can have the key. It\\'s the key that\\'s kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I\\'m free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you\\'re free of him.  I\\'ve got to call my brother.\\nL12766 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ The key, Wade.\\nL12765 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You two, don\\'t you get it? He\\'s using you. You\\'re his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don\\'t you see that?\\nL12764 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Wade, you\\'re done.  Let me have the shop keys.\\nL12703 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right\\'s right.\\nL12702 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Could be.\\nL12701 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You and Mel Gordon?\\nL12700 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Maybe.\\nL12699 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I won\\'t. You interested?\\nL12698 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Don\\'t light that in here. I\\'m allergic.\\nL12697 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Want to buy?\\nL12696 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ What\\'s the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man\\'s place -- he going to stay there?\\nL12695 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.\\nL12694 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Mel\\'s doing some business with me. It\\'s nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.\\nL12693 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You? Why?\\nL12692 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Wade, that wasn\\'t smart. Going out right after the man\\'s father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.\\nL12691 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn\\'t accept it.\\nL12690 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ So?\\nL12689 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.\\nL12688 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Nothing, Wade, I\\'ve been thinking. You don\\'t get enough appreciation around here and it\\'s time we changed things a little.\\nL12687 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What do I have to do for it?\\nL12684 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade\\'s car, fix the clutch.\\nL12683 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ On what you pay me?\\nL12682 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?\\nL12681 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.\\nL12576 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You\\'re a teacher now? Harvard?\\nL12575 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m fine, fine.\\nL12574 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ How you holding up, Wade?\\nL12397 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Well, right now we\\'re not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.\\nL12396 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. A few things.\\nL12395 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Something bugging you?\\nL12394 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It ain\\'t done, if that\\'s what you mean.\\nL12393 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ What the fuck. My day\\'s already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.\\nL12378 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Let\\'s get to the top and talk to Jack first. He\\'ll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I\\'ll put that kid\\'s ass in a sling.\\nL12377 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You want me to follow them to Littleton?\\nL12376 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ That must\\'ve been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.\\nL12375 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Like hell.\\nL12374 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You ain\\'t the hunter Jack is. And he can\\'t drive the grader worth shit.\\nL12373 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I wish you had. I\\'d rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.\\nL12372 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.\\nL12371 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That\\'s what usually happens.\\nL12370 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.\\nL12369 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You mean Twombley?\\nL12368 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Fuck. You don\\'t know how bad or anything?\\nL12367 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Twombley\\'s shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He\\'s okay, I assume.\\nL12366 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?\\nL12365 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C\\'mon, you drive. We\\'ll take my truck.\\nL12364 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I figured you already heard.\\nL12363 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Huh?\\nL12362 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ A hunting accident.

Don\\'t let Lillian get to you. She didn\\'t belong here. That\\'s why she left.\\nL12294 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m not saying that.\\nL12293 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You don\\'t want the extra police pay?\\nL12292 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What am I -- a security guard?

Look, I...\\nL12792 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hi honey.\\nL12791 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ See. Get your boots.\\nL12790 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, lots.\\nL12789 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Wait there. She\\'ll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?\\nL12604 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Let the past be.  I\\'m sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It\\'s like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they\\'re gone.\\nL12603 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'s just...\\nL12602 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ We\\'ve done all our talking, Wade.\\nL12601 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We should talk.\\nL12600 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ No, not anymore. It\\'s too... it\\'s too far.\\nL12599 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You ever come to your father\\'s grave anymore?\\nL12218 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could\\'ve worked this thing out. It\\'s normal, it\\'s even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?\\nL12217 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Don\\'t cause a scene. No one\\'s trying to win any \\'rounds\\'. Don\\'t make it any worse.\\nL12216 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don\\'t want her to go, Lillian.\\nL12213 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you\\'ve won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ\\'s sake.\\nL12212 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ She\\'s grown up some, hasn\\'t she?\\nL12211 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12210 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?\\nL12208 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?\\nL12207 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --\\nL12206 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Where\\'s Jill?\\nL12205 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lillian!\\nL12262 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ From Boston. Evan Twombley\\'s son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they\\'re headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man\\'s out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.\\nL12261 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ I still don\\'t understand --\\nL12260 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Mel Gordon.\\nL12259 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Good. Who?\\nL12258 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know who it is.\\nL12257 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Did you get his number?\\nL12256 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could\\'ve killed somebody.\\nL12255 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?\\nL12844 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don\\'t be silly. Hi, Jill.\\nL12843 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don\\'t lie to me. You\\'re leaving me, I can see that.\\nL12842 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I\\'m just cleaning out some of this stuff that\\'s built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.\\nL12841 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Going somewhere, Margie?\\nL12785 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Look, that\\'s temporary, believe me. There\\'s so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won\\'t matter a bit.\\nL12784 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn\\'t you?\\nL12783 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'s my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can\\'t even think anymore because of it.\\nL12782 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?\\nL12713 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Pop, let\\'s go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.\\nL12712 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What happened?\\nL12582 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade.\\nL12581 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This is nuts.\\nL12534 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don\\'t know for Christ\\'s sake!\\nL12533 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How?\\nL12532 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course! I would\\'ve heard.\\nL12531 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Think they\\'re alright?\\nL12530 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Strange.\\nL12529 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The truck\\'s here. Looks like they\\'ve stayed inside since the snow started.\\nL12528 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Are you sure they\\'re home? Did you call?\\nL12527 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won\\'t take long.\\nL12526 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I know your parents.\\nL12525 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don\\'t you think it\\'s proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?\\nL12524 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Did you tell them?  That we were coming?\\nL12516 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Good.\\nL12515 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Alright. I\\'ll think about it.\\nL12514 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It\\'s not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?\\nL12513 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You\\'ve been married twice --\\nL12512 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'ve been thinking about it, that\\'s all.\\nL12511 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Oh, Wade.\\nL12510 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There\\'s another thing I\\'ve been thinking about. I don\\'t know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we\\'ve never talked about it. But I\\'ve been thinking lately, I\\'ve been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.\\nL12509 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Then... I guess you have to.\\nL12508 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m her father -- supposed to be, but I\\'m not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I\\'ve been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.\\nL12507 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don\\'t you think, do you still think it\\'s a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?\\nL12506 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ It\\'s nice.\\nL12505 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ After making love. I like it. It\\'s nice to see that in a grown-up person.\\nL12504 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What way?\\nL12503 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.\\nL12502 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You knew me as a kid.\\nL12501 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I can see what you looked like as a kid.\\nL12499 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ But not now.\\nL12498 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. Not for money. But, if somebody\\'d given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.\\nL12497 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You wouldn\\'t have done anything like that, shot someone for money.\\nL12496 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I just know Jack\\'s lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he\\'s like inside. He\\'s a lot like I was at his age.\\nL12495 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?\\nL12494 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government\\'s been investigating his links with the Mafia.\\nL12493 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack wouldn\\'t kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?\\nL12492 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.\\nL12491 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack doesn\\'t need money.\\nL12490 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Money.\\nL12489 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?\\nL12488 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'ve been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I\\'ve been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.\\nL12487 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ ...Jack\\'s turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it\\'s like, when he found out he couldn\\'t play ball anymore, he changed. Now he\\'s like everyone else.\\nL12486 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m sure, I\\'m positive it didn\\'t happen the way Jack says it did.\\nL12485 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard he was drunk at Toby\\'s last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...\\nL12484 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There\\'s something funny about that shooting. There\\'s lots funny about it, actually.\\nL12483 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack\\'s sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he\\'ll be okay in a few weeks.\\nL12350 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Okay.\\nL12349 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tonight. Let\\'s get together.\\nL12348 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Call me.\\nL12344 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The hell she isn\\'t. Lillian\\'s been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I\\'m gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I\\'ve been thinking about it a lot. It\\'s like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.\\nL12343 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No you don\\'t. You\\'re pissed, that\\'s all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian\\'s not out to get you.\\nL12342 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I mean that.\\nL12341 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You don\\'t mean that.\\nL12340 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m going to start one of those custody suits. I don\\'t give a fucking shit. You know?\\nL12339 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I\\'m sorry.\\nL12338 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Forget it.\\nL12337 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?\\nL12336 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Said what?\\nL12335 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I\\'m sorry about what I said.\\nL12334 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12333 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?\\nL12233 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12232 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?\\nL12231 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ See you tomorrow, maybe.\\nL12230 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don\\'t worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c\\'mon, Wade, give me a break.\\nL12225 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I\\'m off.\\nL12224 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Okay. She\\'s fine.\\nL12223 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How\\'s she doing?\\nL12222 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ For a while.\\nL12221 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ New hat?  Jill\\'s up, I see.\\nL12564 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.\\nL12563 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Can --?\\nL12562 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It makes me sad.\\nL12555 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Is...? She\\'s dead then?\\nL12554 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ When did she die?\\nL12553 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Coffee\\'s perked.\\nL12550 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes\\'ll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?\\nL12549 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It\\'s broke I guess. There\\'s an electric in the bedroom.\\nL12548 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You\\'re not using it today?\\nL12547 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ There\\'s a furnace.\\nL12546 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.\\nL12482 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven\\'t got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I\\'m pissed enough to do it now!\\nL12481 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes. Here\\'s your ticket.\\nL12480 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.\\nL12479 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don\\'t give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I\\'m just --\\nL12478 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You\\'re talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?\\nL12477 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don\\'t ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.\\nL12476 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Hold on!\\nL12475 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--\\nL12474 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you\\'re telling me you\\'re giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You\\'re nuts?\\nL12473 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.\\nL12472 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?\\nL12471 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don\\'t call ahead for an appointment.\\nL12470 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ I said, \\'Next time, phone ahead.\\'\\nL12469 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How\\'s that?\\nL12468 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.\\nL12467 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Can\\'t it wait, then?\\nL12466 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, no. No, it\\'s a... it\\'s a traffic thing. No big deal.\\nL12465 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Something about my father?\\nL12464 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I\\'m the local police officer.\\nL12463 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.\\nL12462 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yes, I\\'m...

We were up very late.\\nL12460 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was... I\\'m Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?\\nL12459 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Who are you?\\nL12840 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, he\\'s out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I\\'d stay away from him if I were you. He\\'s real pissed.\\nL12839 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He got his deer yet?\\nL12838 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Well, I guess -- that\\'s what he said.\\nL12837 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ His office. You mean my old office.\\nL12836 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he\\'s looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.\\nL12832 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It\\'s called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.\\nL12831 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?\\nL12358 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I... I\\'ve been out on the grader all morning. Twombley\\'s summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon\\'s. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.\\nL12357 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you\\'d know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?\\nL12356 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where... how\\'d you hear that?\\nL12355 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The other guy.\\nL12354 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jack?\\nL12353 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That\\'s what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.\\nL12352 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.\\nL12351 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You talked to Jack?\\nL12347 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg! You got orders!\\nL12346 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I\\'m more than pissed, Margie. I\\'m a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.\\nL12345 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg!\\nL12331 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Aw, c\\'mon, I was only saying there\\'s something wrong with \"Home Made Cooking\", that\\'s all. The sign\\'s fine. What it says is wrong.\\nL12330 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ This town sucks.\\nL12329 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I\\'m not finding fault. It\\'s a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.\\nL12328 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It\\'s people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.\\nL12327 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The sign.

He\\'s dying to get in your pants, you know.\\nL12228 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Take care, Wade.\\nL12864 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don\\'t know you. My goddamn father and I don\\'t know you.\\nL12863 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing.

Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman\\'s head.\\nL12589 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Listen, it\\'s no big deal, Pop.\\nL12561 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.\\nL12560 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why didn\\'t you call and have the furnace fixed?\\nL12559 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ In the living room.\\nL12558 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Is there something wrong with the phone?\\nL12557 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don\\'t bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.\\nL12556 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12545 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ She\\'s coming.\\nL12544 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where\\'s Ma?\\nL12542 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12541 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ We\\'re alright. Your Ma\\'s sleeping. You want me to get her?\\nL12540 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How you and Ma doing? Haven\\'t seen you in town for a while.\\nL12539 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ From Wickham\\'s. Been a while. Like some coffee?\\nL12538 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You remember Margie Fogg?\\nL12537 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Sleeping.\\nL12536 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where\\'s Ma?\\nL12324 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You no-good pup!\\nL12323 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nothing.\\nL12322 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!\\nL12312 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Atta-go.\\nL12311 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Just do it.\\nL12310 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ A lesson in work and its rewards. You\\'ll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!\\nL12309 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.\\nL12771 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God\\'s sake, and get your tooth pulled, don\\'t trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.\\nL12770 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That\\'s what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?\\nL12769 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ For what?\\nL12768 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know what it means. I\\'m just running out of ways to use it.\\nL12727 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ But you gotta hear this. You won\\'t believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I\\'m in his office.\\nL12726 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, are you alright?\\nL12725 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don\\'t know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It\\'s the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie\\'s being so upset -- one thing on top of another.\\nL12649 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That\\'s what you think.\\nL12648 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn\\'t afflicted by that man\\'s violence.\\nL12647 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, I never heard that one.\\nL12646 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.\\nL12645 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We\\'d have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.\\nL12644 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It wasn\\'t me. I wasn\\'t there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.\\nL12643 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You think I wouldn\\'t remember a thing like that?\\nL12642 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It may have happened, but not the way you said.\\nL12641 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?\\nL12640 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I hate to disappoint you, but I don\\'t think it happened.\\nL12639 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.\\nL12638 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.\\nL12637 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I care about what happened. The truth. I\\'m a student of history, remember?\\nL12636 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Right\\'s right, goddamnit! Don\\'t you care what\\'s right?\\nL12635 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Not particularly.\\nL12634 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'s too neat. Things ain\\'t that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don\\'t that piss you off?\\nL12633 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack\\'s probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain\\'t got his deer yet and don\\'t want his license pulled.\\nL12632 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ A hunting accident is perfect.\\nL12631 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ So Mel Gordon wouldn\\'t want a professional hit. That\\'d make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.\\nL12630 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Here\\'s my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.\\nL12629 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn\\'t I?\\nL12628 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Okay. It\\'s likely there are people in the union who don\\'t want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who\\'s vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What\\'s his name, Mel Gordon?\\nL12627 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don\\'t know. You tell me.\\nL12626 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They wouldn\\'t deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?\\nL12625 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who\\'d pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.\\nL12624 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Money.\\nL12623 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Motive. You gotta have a motive.\\nL12622 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.\\nL12621 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then who shot him?\\nL12620 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ That it wasn\\'t an accident.\\nL12619 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Which is?\\nL12618 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.\\nL12617 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Find them everywhere. \\nL12616 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Want to know what I think happened?\\nL12615 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.\\nL12614 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?\\nL12613 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to let the gas run out. I don\\'t want the bastard driving drunk, and he\\'s always drunk now. After, we\\'ll hide the keys.\\nL12612 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. She\\'ll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can\\'t leave him alone here, he\\'ll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it\\'ll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I\\'m gonna see him tomorrow. All hell\\'s gonna break loose, but it\\'s worth it.\\nL12611 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, do you still plan to get married?\\nL12610 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What about her?\\nL12609 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Margie?\\nL12573 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I forgot.\\nL12572 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ No thanks. I don\\'t drink.\\nL12571 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Anyone else want one? Rolfe?\\nL12569 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?\\nL12568 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.\\nL12458 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, no, I haven\\'t. Not really. I\\'ve growled a little, but I haven\\'t bit.\\nL12457 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Haven\\'t you already done a bit of that?\\nL12456 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I\\'m going to bite back. I swear it.\\nL12455 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Get some sleep.\\nL12454 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.\\nL12453 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Don\\'t think about it. You\\'re exhausted.\\nL12452 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, \\'cause of Jill.\\nL12451 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What happened?\\nL12450 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.\\nL12449 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Who?\\nL12448 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.\\nL12447 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ How was she?\\nL12446 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The night before the shooting.\\nL12445 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Huh?\\nL12444 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lillian was here. In Lawford.\\nL12443 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.\\nL12442 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, it was an accident.\\nL12441 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ You think Jack shot him?\\nL12440 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No shit.\\nL12439 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Twombley.\\nL12438 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who?\\nL12437 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.\\nL12436 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It\\'ll come out Jack lied and the kid\\'ll get hung for it.\\nL12435 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, not tonight. I\\'m in bed too. I\\'m calling because I need you to listen. You\\'re supposed to be a smart guy. You\\'re a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn\\'t see Twombley shot but he did.\\nL12434 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, it\\'s late. I know you\\'re probably at Toby\\'s, but I\\'m in bed reading. We got different habits.\\nL12433 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He\\'s my best friend.\\nL12432 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ There was something. It happened up your way.\\nL12431 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?\\nL12430 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade?\\nL12429 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.\\nL17221 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jim... for godsake!\\nL17220 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy.

I know exactly how you feel.\\nL16674 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That\\'s not really the point.\\nL16673 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Some kids were teasing you?\\nL16672 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it\\'s me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn\\'t take a genius to figure which is more important.\\nL16671 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your father never means to be so...\\nL16670 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When I write my memoirs I think I\\'ll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.\\nL16669 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, it\\'s okay.  After all, he is the President, right?\\nL16668 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I\\'m sorry, honey.\\nL16667 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He\\'s in a meeting.

Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.\\nL16917 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?\\nL16916 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch\\'s cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.\\nL16915 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ So, you study world events, little one. That\\'s good for a girl your age.\\nL16914 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You\\'re one of Stravanavitch\\'s men.\\nL16907 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, thank you.

You should never have left the hospital.\\nL18792 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.\\nL18791 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We can\\'t go back.

Just go.\\nL18564 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you\\'re sick.

And by the way, Ted, I\\'m leaving you for Simon.\\nL18563 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ His name\\'s David Stockman.  He\\'s been here twenty years, that\\'s all he says.\\nL18559 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.\\nL18558 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.\\nL18557 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn\\'t been the same since.\\nL18556 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who\\'s that, Ted?\\nL18555 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It\\'ll make you feel a lot better.\\nL18548 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, I loved you and I\\'ll always love you. But I need Simon.  He\\'s stable.  He\\'s a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.\\nL18547 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, what happened to us?\\nL18546 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, please.

It\\'s all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It\\'s all here!\\nL18528 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Let\\'s relax tonight, just the two of us. I\\'ll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.\\nL18527 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There\\'s nothing wrong with me!\\nL18526 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you\\'re overworked.  You\\'ve been flying yourself into the ground.\\nL18525 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ask Simon.\\nL18524 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, what\\'s wrong?\\nL18512 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I mean the Mercury flight.  It\\'s not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.\\nL18511 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.\\nL18510 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It\\'s got to be stopped!\\nL18506 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That\\'s not important now, Elaine.

He\\'s been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.\\nL18688 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I mean for Ted.\\nL18687 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.\\nL18686 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?\\nL18685 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ So you see, our task isn\\'t made any easier by Ted\\'s refusal to admit that he\\'s sick.\\nL18684 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted\\'s problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...\\nL18683 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.\\nL19179 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, what are you saying?!\\nL19178 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Maybe.\\nL19177 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, I didn\\'t want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You\\'ll die out there.\\nL18907 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?\\nL18906 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ My career is shot.\\nL18904 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ We\\'re computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.\\nL18903 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Can\\'t we change course?\\nL18902 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He tried to disconnect ROK.

But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.\\nL18394 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And I can hardly believe that I\\'m engaged to someone like you, Simon.

Now I\\'d like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.\\nL18593 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ We don\\'t have much time.  Let\\'s move. I\\'ll explain everything.\\nL18592 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Mr. Kurtz, I presume.\\nL18591 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Captain Oveur?\\nL18475 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Now he\\'s D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.\\nL18474 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Ah, yes, the Institute, I\\'m familiar with it.\\nL18473 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Let\\'s go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.\\nL18472 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ It\\'s a privilege to meet you, sir, I\\'m familiar with all your work.\\nL18471 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Yes.\\nL18470 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Say, isn\\'t that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?\\nL18469 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.\\nL18468 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You folks need any help?\\nL18608 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ But that\\'s not a door.  The door\\'s over there.\\nL18607 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don\\'t try to stop me!\\nL18606 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You can\\'t go in there!\\nL18605 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o\\'clock.\\nL18604 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All right, it\\'s a matter of death.\\nL18603 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You\\'ll have to be more specific than that, sir.\\nL18602 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No, dammit.  It\\'s a matter of life or death.\\nL18601 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Do you have an appointment, sir?\\nL18600 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to see Bud Kruger.\\nL18989 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Pull yourself together!  We\\'ve got to...\\nL18988 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Don\\'t talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!\\nL18987 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then Elaine was right.\\nL18986 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That damn computer has taken over.  I\\'m getting out.\\nL18985 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kurtz, you\\'re drunk.  Who\\'s in command of this ship?\\nL18984 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Striker.\\nL18519 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I know you\\'ve been subtly spreading the word that I\\'m having a breakdown.\\nL18518 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You\\'re tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.\\nL18517 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look at this wiring.  It\\'s shorting out under high temperatures.\\nL18516 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You\\'re seeing bugs where they don\\'t exist, Striker.\\nL18509 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That\\'s right, Striker.  And we\\'re getting married when we return.\\nL18508 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you on the Mercury mission?\\nL18816 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.\\nL18815 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No.  It\\'s hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father\\'s dying.\\nL18814 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.\\nL18813 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there\\'s change in the two people who share that love.\\nL18812 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sure.  But that\\'s only when the love itself goes unchanged.\\nL18811 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Not if the people change together in relation to that love.\\nL18810 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.\\nL18809 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Love\\'s the same as it always was.  It\\'s people who change.\\nL18808 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We were in love but I\\'m not sure I know what love is anymore.\\nL18807 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No.  I mean your relationship.\\nL18806 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.\\nL18805 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Do you want to talk about it.\\nL18804 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I\\'ll take a look at it.  I\\'m a nurse.\\nL18803 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I\\'m getting over it.  If a relationship isn\\'t working, you can\\'t force it.\\nL18802 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You\\'ve been hurt.\\nL18541 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You don\\'t have to excuse yourself.  I\\'m a nurse.  I understand.\\nL18540 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I\\'m familiar with your work, Doctor. You\\'ll have to excuse me, I have to go.\\nL18539 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Yes.  He\\'s dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.\\nL18538 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?\\nL18537 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You don\\'t have to thank me, I\\'m a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.\\nL18536 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh... oh, thank you.  It\\'s nothing.\\nL18535 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I\\'m a nurse.  Can I be of some help?\\nL19838 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ That\\'s a very nice compliment, and I\\'d like to say that...you\\'ve done the same for me.\\nL19837 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Just in case I don\\'t have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven\\'t spent so many pleasant hours for many years.\\nL19836 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ No. I\\'m all alone.\\nL19835 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I\\'m sure we\\'ll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you\\'d like me to give someone?\\nL19714 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ That\\'s a lovely name. Mine\\'s Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me \\'Bubbles.\\'\\nL19713 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Mine\\'s Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.\\nL19712 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don\\'t even know each other\\'s names...full names I mean.\\nL19711 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ I wish I could fool myself into believing that that\\'s the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.\\nL19710 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn\\'t have time for marriage.\\nL19709 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, I\\'m afraid that\\'s a question that\\'s all too easy to answer.\\nL19708 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ But I think it\\'s time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven\\'t you ever married?\\nL19707 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, after a thing like that you wouldn\\'t be expected to.\\nL19706 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn\\'t function socially and I couldn\\'t function in business.\\nL19402 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ No. I\\'m from Washington, D.C. I\\'m a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen\\'s Assocation.\\nL19401 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, it really wasn\\'t a vacation. You see, I\\'m a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?\\nL19400 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?\\nL19399 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.\\nL19398 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Thank you. Cream?\\nL19397 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Ah, won\\'t you sit down?\\nL19396 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ That\\'s very nice of you. Thank you.\\nL19395 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.\\nL19611 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.\\nL19610 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ ...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.\\nL19608 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, no! I\\'ll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.\\nL19607 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn\\'t have time to tell me very much.\\nL19606 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Something about a plane with no pilot?\\nL19605 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Well, to tell the truth, they really didn\\'t fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.\\nL19604 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you\\'ve got a real emergency down there.\\nL19603 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.\\nL19602 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Hello, I\\'m Paul Carey from the airline. I\\'m here to pick up Captain Kramer.\\nL19789 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Excuse me, Doc, I\\'ve got a plane to land.\\nL19788 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ And the last thing he said to me, \"Doc,\" he said, \"Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they\\'ve got and win just one for the Zipper. I don\\'t know where I\\'ll be then, Doc,\" he said, \"but I won\\'t smell too good. That\\'s for sure.\"\\nL19787 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ George Zipp said that?\\nL19757 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I\\'m doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!\\nL19756 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Surely there must be something you can do.\\nL19755 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I won\\'t deceive you, Mister Striker. We\\'re running out of time.\\nL19754 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Yes, everything they\\'ve got. How are the passengers doing?\\nL19753 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?\\nL19736 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?\\nL19735 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ ...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.\\nL19653 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Let\\'s see. Those are the flaps, that\\'s the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.\\nL19652 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Elaine, I haven\\'t time to put this gently, so I\\'ll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we\\'ve got.\\nL19633 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It\\'s an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!\\nL19632 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I <u>am</u> serious, and don\\'t call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?\\nL19631 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Surely you can\\'t be serious.\\nL19630 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Can you fly this airplane and land it?\\nL19629 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Both pilots!\\nL19554 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I\\'m not sure. I haven\\'t seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.\\nL19553 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ What is it, Doctor? What\\'s happening?\\nL19551 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ No, I mean we can\\'t <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We\\'ve got to go through to Chicago!\\nL19550 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ You can\\'t take a guess for another two hours?\\nL19549 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Well...not for another two hours.\\nL19548 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Can\\'t you take a guess?\\nL19545 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ I can\\'t tell.\\nL19544 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Captain, how soon can we land?\\nL19601 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn\\'t have fish for dinner.\\nL19600 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No. No one that I know of.\\nL19599 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well...\\nL19598 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can\\'t even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?\\nL19597 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No.\\nL19596 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Elaine, you\\'re a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?\\nL19576 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.\\nL19575 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Just how serious is it, doctor?\\nL19573 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He had fish, too.\\nL19572 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Let\\'s see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?\\nL19571 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.\\nL19559 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He had fish.\\nL19558 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ What did he have?\\nL19557 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.\\nL19556 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.\\nL19555 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ What was it we had for dinner tonight?\\nL19541 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Certainly.\\nL19540 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ It\\'s a big building with patients. But that\\'s not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.\\nL19539 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ A hospital? What is it?\\nL19538 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ You\\'d better tell the Captain. We\\'ve got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.\\nL19534 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Yes. Yes, of course.\\nL19533 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?\\nL19532 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ That\\'s right.\\nL19531 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sir. Excuse me, sir. I\\'m sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?\\nL19857 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Uh-huh.\\nL19856 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ See them, Elaine?\\nL19833 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The gear is down.\\nL19832 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Tell them the gear is down and we\\'re ready to land.\\nL19831 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I wanted you to know -- now -- I\\'m very proud.\\nL19830 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Yes?\\nL19829 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted...\\nL19781 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I don\\'t care. I just don\\'t have what it takes. They\\'d be better off with someone who\\'d never flown before.\\nL19780 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But Ted, you\\'re the only...\\nL19775 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit\\'s gonna hit the fan.\\nL19774 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What happened, Ted? What went wrong?\\nL19773 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Rats! I\\'ve lost number three.\\nL19693 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It\\'s a damn good thing you don\\'t know how much he hates your guts.\\nL19692 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ It\\'s a damn good thing he doesn\\'t know how much I hate his guts.\\nL19691 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.\\nL19690 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.\\nL19689 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And a little ice!\\nL19688 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ And a little ice.\\nL19687 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Rain.\\nL19651 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ That\\'s what I\\'ve been trying to tell these people.\\nL19650 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted! What are you doing? You can\\'t fly this plane!\\nL19514 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.\\nL19513 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, I don\\'t want to stay here. It\\'s time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.\\nL19512 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I think they\\'re getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I\\'ll teach them baseball!\\nL19473 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ That\\'s Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he\\'s Ethel Merman.\\nL19472 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What\\'s his problem?\\nL19468 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.\\nL19467 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.\\nL19466 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you\\'ll be out in a week. Isn\\'t that wonderful?\\nL19465 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn\\'t return from that raid.\\nL19464 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It\\'s a big building where the generals meet. But that\\'s not important right now. They\\'ve cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn\\'t that good news?\\nL19463 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Headquarters!? What is it?\\nL19462 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You got a telegram from head'"
